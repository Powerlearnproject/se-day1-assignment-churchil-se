#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
Importance of software engineering in the technology industry include:
1. Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias, especially for critical applications like healthcare,finance. 
2. Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
3. Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
4. Security - implement protection practices like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users' information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Birth of Software Engineering (1968): The 1968 NATO Conference introduced the term "software engineering" to address the software crisis, emphasizing a systematic approach to software development.  

2. Waterfall Model (1970s): Introduced a linear, phased development process, bringing structure to software projects but lacking flexibility for changing requirements.  

3. Agile Methodology (2001): The Agile Manifesto promoted iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability, transforming how modern software is built.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning:
Define the project’s goals, scope, and resources.
Conducting feasibility studies and creating a project roadmap.
2. Requirements Gathering & Analysis:
Collecting and analyzing user needs and system requirements.
Documenting specifications to guide the development process.
3. Design:
Creating system architecture and technical designs (e.g., database structure, user interfaces).
Ensuring designs align with functional and non-functional requirements.
4. Implementation (Coding)
Writing and developing the software based on design specifications.
Following coding standards and ensuring proper documentation.
5. Testing:
Identifying and fixing bugs through unit, integration, and system testing.
Validating that the software meets requirements and functions correctly.
6. Deployment:
Releasing the software to a live environment or user base.
Deployment may involve phased rollouts or a full production launch.
7. Maintenance & Support:
Providing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements post-launch.
Ensuring the software remains secure, reliable, and efficient.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Process Structure:
Waterfall: Follows a linear, sequential approach—each phase (e.g., planning, design, coding) is completed before the next begins.
Agile: Uses an iterative, incremental approach—work is divided into sprints or cycles, allowing for continuous development and improvement.
2. Flexibility:
Waterfall: Inflexible—difficult to accommodate changes once the project has started.
Agile: Highly flexible—easily adapts to changing requirements throughout the development cycle.
3. Customer Involvement:
Waterfall: Minimal involvement—customers are consulted mainly at the beginning (requirements phase) and end (delivery phase).
Agile: Continuous involvement—customers provide regular feedback during each sprint or iteration.
4. Delivery Timeline:
Waterfall: One-time delivery—the final product is delivered after all phases are complete.
Agile: Incremental delivery—functional parts of the software are delivered frequently throughout the project.
5. Documentation:
Waterfall: Extensive documentation—detailed records are created for each stage and are essential for progress.
Agile: Minimal documentation—the focus is on working software rather than maintaining exhaustive records.
6. Risk Management:
Waterfall: Higher risk—problems are often discovered late in the development process.
Agile: Lower risk—risks are identified and mitigated early through regular testing and feedback.
7. Team Collaboration:
Waterfall: Structured roles—teams work in silos, and each team handles a specific phase.
Agile: Collaborative teams—cross-functional teams work together throughout the project.

When to Use Waterfall:
Projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government or legal systems).
Heavily regulated industries requiring detailed documentation (e.g., healthcare).
Short, well-defined projects with clear outcomes (e.g., manufacturing software).

When to Use Agile:
Projects with changing requirements (e.g., mobile apps and SaaS products).
Customer-driven environments requiring continuous feedback (e.g., e-commerce platforms).
Complex, long-term projects needing regular improvements (e.g., cloud-based services).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
Developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software.
Reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer
collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
Creates development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
Confirms that the software meets the requirements before deployment. 
Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
Develop and execute automation scripts using open-source tools.
3. Project Manager
Assemble and lead the software development team.
Discuss the project and its requirements with the client and software developers.
Create a blueprint for the project.
Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
Deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs are software applications that provide comprehensive tools for developers to write, test, and debug code within a single interface. They streamline the development process and improve productivity.
Key Benefits of IDEs:
Increased Efficiency: Features like code auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools reduce development time.
Error Detection: Real-time error checking helps identify and fix bugs early in the coding process.
Project Management: Provides tools to organize large projects, making it easier to manage multiple files and modules.
Integrated Tools: Combines essential tools (e.g., compilers, debuggers, and version control plugins) for a seamless workflow.
Examples of IDEs:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
PyCharm
2. VCS are tools that track and manage changes to a project’s source code over time. They are crucial for maintaining code integrity, collaboration, and project history.
Key Benefits of VCS:
Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other’s changes.
Version Tracking: Keeps a history of every modification, enabling developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Code Integrity: Ensures backup and recovery, protecting against accidental loss or errors.
Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features or bug fixes and merging them back when complete.
Examples of VCS:
Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
2. Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
3. Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
4. Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
5. Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
6. Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture and emphasise reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
2. Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. Help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
3. System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions. It helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
4. Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviours. Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Write about software development."

Improved Prompt:
"Write a 500-word article explaining the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including real-world examples and best practices for each phase."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Clear Scope: It specifies that the focus should be on SDLC rather than general software development.
Defined Length: The 500-word requirement helps control content depth.
Specific Details: It asks for real-world examples and best practices, making the response more practical and valuable.
Concise Yet Informative: It eliminates ambiguity while keeping the instructions straightforward.
